# Icons

This package includes svg icons in our project.

## Convention

- If the icon is not a square, add a `NotSquare` suffix.
- If the icon is uncolored, add a `Plain` suffix.
- Icon for brands (e.g. MetaMask) puts in the `brands/` folder.
- Other icons puts in the `general/` folder (and might be re-categorized later).

## To add a new icon

- Place it in the correct folder
- Export it from `folder/index.tsx`
