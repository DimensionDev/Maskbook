                        cloud, including identity, Persona, encrypted social information, wallet (optional), etc. The
                        user needs to set up a backup password to encrypt the selected data. If the user chooses to back
                        up the Mask wallet, the user needs to enter the payment password to verify the wallet. When the
                        user chooses to back up via cloud provided by Mask Network, the user needs to set up a mobile
                        phone number or email address for sending and receiving verification codes so that the encrypted
                        backup data can be fetched from cloud.

                        click it to jump to the third-party DApp and use the services provided by the DApp. As Mask
                        Network provides non-commercial integration services, it will integrate plug-ins provided by
                        community members and excellent teams of third-party DApps. Before using any wallet-related
                        plug-ins in Mask Network (including Mask Network’s own DApps and third-party DApps), the users
                        need to confirm the risk warning.

                        Transaction Records. We will display transaction records through blockchain systems. The

                        The file storage system currently used by Mask Network is Arweave's permanent storage system.
                        Currently, Mask Network is the official payer of storage service fees. As long as the storage
                        funds of Mask Network are sufficient, Mask Network will continue to pay for users. We do not
                        rule out the possibility that with the rapid expansion of Mask Network users in the future,
                        users may need to pay for file storage by themselves. Arweave's file storage can only be
                        encrypted and stored by user's own account. Mask Network cannot parse any user’s encrypted
                        files. The files can only be decrypted by users of Mask Network themselves. As the file storage
                        service is provided by Arweave, Arweave is responsible for any file problems that might occur
                        and Mask Network shall not be held accountable.

                    <p>
                        Users should learn about the following common problems when accepting the above services
                        provided by Mask Network:
                    </p>

                                a). Adhering to the decentralized characteristics of blockchain, Mask Network provides
                                decentralized services which are essentially different from banking financial
                                institutions in order to protect the security of users' digital assets. Users should
                                understand that Mask Network does not provide the following services:
                            </p>
                            <ol>

                    <p>
                        b). Since Mask Network does not provide the above services, users should keep the mobile devices
                        with installation of Mask Network safe, back up the identity code of Mask Network, back up
                        wallet payment password, mnemonic phrase, private key and Keystore by themselves. If the user
                        should lose the mobile device, or delete the identity code of Mask Network without backup, or
                        delete the wallet without backup, or forget the wallet password, private key, mnemonic phrase,
                        Keystore, or if the wallet is stolen, Mask Network cannot restore the wallet or retrieve the
                        wallet password, private key, Mnemonic phrase or Keystore; If the user should make a mistake
                        during a transaction (such as entering the wrong transfer address), Mask Network cannot cancel
                        the transaction.

                    <p>
                        c). Mask Network and the digital asset management services provided by Mask Network do not
                        include all existing digital assets. Please do not operate any digital assets that Mask Network
                        does not support through Mask Network.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        d). Mask Network is only a digital asset management tool for users, not an exchange or trading
                        platform. Although this agreement will refer to "transactions" many times, it generally means
                        the transfer and receiving operations conducted by users using Mask Network, which is
                        essentially different from "transactions" conducted on exchanges or trading platforms.

                    <p>
                        e). The integrated DApps on Mask Network include DApps owned by Mask Network and DApps that are
                        provided by third-party platforms. For DApps provided by third-party platforms, Mask Network
                        only provides blockchain explorer for users to enter the DApps. Before accepting the service or
                        conducting transactions, users must judge and evaluate by themselves whether there is risk in
                        the service or transaction provided by the third-party DApps.

                    Keystore and other information by themselves. Without authorization, Mask Network is not responsible
                    for keeping the above information for users. All risks, liabilities, losses, and expenses caused by

            <div>
                <p>
                    b). Follow the information prompts. You understand and agree to follow the information prompts
                    provided by Mask Network and operate in accordance with the content of the information prompts.

            <div>
                <p>
                    c). You know and understand that Mask Network is not obliged to perform due diligence on the linked
                    third-party DApp services or transactions, and you should make rational investment decisions and
                    bear the corresponding investment risks independently.

            <div>
                <p>
                    d). Actively complete identity verification. When Mask Network reasonably believes that your
                    transaction behavior or transaction condition is abnormal, or that your identity information is
                    suspicious, or that your ID or other necessary documents should be verified, please actively
                    cooperate with Mask Network to verify your valid ID or other necessary documents and complete the
                    relevant identity verification in time.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>3). Transfer.</p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    a). You understand that because of the "irrevocable" attribute of blockchain-based operations, when
                    you use Mask Network’s transfer function, you should bear the consequences caused by your mistakes
                    by yourself (including but not limited to wrong transfer address, your own choice of the node
                    server).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    b). You understand that when using the Mask Network service, the following situations may lead to
                    "transaction failure" or "packing timeout" in transfers:
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>iv. Technical failures with network, equipment, etc.;</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>v. Blockchain network congestion, failure and other reasons cause transactions to be abandoned;</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    vi. Your address or the address of the counterparty is identified as a special address, such as a
                    high-risk address, an exchange address, an ICO address, a Token address, etc.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                4). You know that Mask Network only provides you with transfer tools. After you use Mask Network to
                complete the transfer, Mask Network has completed all the obligations of the current service. Mask
                Network will not bear any obligations for other disputes.
            </p>
            <p>
                5). Legal compliance. You understand that you should follow the requirements of relevant laws,
                regulations and national policies when operating on Mask Network or using DApps on Mask Network to
                conduct transactions.
            </p>
            <p>6). Service fees and tax liability:</p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    (a) Mask Network does not charge you any form of service fee or handling fee for the time being, and
                    specific terms will be further agreed or announced when certain services need to be charged in the
                    future;
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    (b) When you use Mask Network to transfer funds, you should pay miner fees, and the amount is
                    determined by you. Miner fees are collected by the relevant blockchain system;
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    (c) You know that under certain circumstances, if your transfer operation is not completed because
                    of your environment and unstable network status, the relevant blockchain system will still charge
                    miner fees;
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    (d) You are responsible for paying all taxable expenses and other expenses incurred by you for
                    trading on Mask Network.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h6>5. Risk Warning</h6>
            <p>
                1). You understand that due to the unsound laws, regulations and policies in the field of digital
                assets, there might be major risks such as inability to cash out digital assets and technical
                instability. What’s more, the price volatility of digital assets is much higher than other financial
                assets. We cautiously remind you that you should rationally choose to hold or sell any digital asset
                based on your financial situation and risk appetite. Mask Network provides the service of viewing the
                third-party market trend, which displays only search results from capturing the exchange rate of digital
                assets on some exchanges, and does not represent the latest market trend or the best offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                2). When using the Mask Network service, if you or your counterparty fail to comply with the agreement,
                or with the operation prompts and rules on related pages such as website instructions, transactions,
                payments, sending and receiving lucky drops, Mask Network does not guarantee that the transaction will
                be completed smoothly, and Mask Network is not liable for losses. If the foregoing situation occurs and
                the money has been credited to your or your counterparty’s Mask Network wallet or third-party wallet,
                you understand that due to the "irreversible" attribute of blockchain operations and the "irrevocable"
                characteristic of related transactions, you and your counterparty shall bear the corresponding risks and
                consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                3). When you use the third-party DApp services integrated by Mask Network or conduct transactions, for
                your benefit, Mask Network recommends that you carefully read this agreement and Mask Network prompts,
                understand the transaction party and product information, and carefully assess the risks before taking
                action. All your transactions in third-party DApps are your personal behaviors. A binding contractual
                relationship is established between you and your counterparty, not with Mask Network. Mask Network
                assumes no responsibility for all risks, liabilities, losses, and expenses caused by your trading
                operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                4). During the transaction, you should judge by yourself whether the counterparty is a person with full
                civil capacity and decide whether to trade with the counterparty or transfer funds to the counterparty,
                and you shall bear all risks related to this.
            </p>
            <p>
                5). During the transfer process, if there are abnormal information prompts such as "transaction failed"
                and "package timeout", you should reconfirm through the official channel of the relevant blockchain
                system or other blockchain query tools to avoid duplicate transfer; otherwise, all losses and expenses
                caused by this shall be borne by you.
            </p>
            <p>
                6). You understand that after you create or import a wallet on Mask Network, your keystore, private key,
                mnemonic phrase and other information are only stored in your current mobile device, not on the Mask
                Network or Mask Network servers. You can change your mobile device by synchronizing your wallet and by
                other ways according to the operation guide provided by Mask Network. However, if you do not save or
                back up your wallet password, private key, mnemonic phrase, keystore and other information, when your
                device is lost, your digital assets will be lost consequentially. Mask Network cannot retrieve it for
                you and you shall bear the corresponding loss by yourself. When you export, save or back up wallet
                passwords, private keys, mnemonics, keystore and other information, if the information is leaked, or if
                the device or server that has stored or backed up the above information is hacked or controlled, your
                digital assets will be lost consequentially. Mask Network cannot retrieve it for you and you shall bear
                the corresponding loss by yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                7). We recommend that you back up your wallet password, private key, mnemonic phrase, and keystore
                securely when creating or importing a wallet. Please do not use the following backup methods:
                screenshots, emails, notepads, text messages, WeChat, QQ and other electronic backup methods. We
                recommend that you write down information such as mnemonics and keystores on a paper notebook, and you
                can also store your electronic data in a password manager.
            </p>
            <p>
                8). We recommend that you use Mask Network in a secure network environment and ensure that your mobile
                device is not jailbroken or rooted to avoid possible security risks.
