# Plugin: Ideamarket

Integrate [Ideamarket](https://ideamarket.io/) to mask.io

- [x] Detect ideamarket url
- [x] lists all ideamarket tokens
- [x] list user tokens
- [x] Able to search for any tokens by name (server-side)

After some talk with ideamarket team, it turned out that buying and selling ideamarket tokens directly from mask.io would very complicated to implement. As a result, I decided to go back and simply redirect to the corresponding token page when the user clicks on the 'buy' or 'sell' button.
