Users of Mask Network can share files to social platforms through this link. By using encrypted files, you can ensure the security of your files and prevent privacy leakage. <br/><br/>It should be noted that any user who has the link can download and share the file. With the characteristics of decentralized file storage systems, your uploaded files can never be deleted or tampered. Please upload files containing personal privacy with caution. <br/><br/>The Web3 File Service provided by Mask Network enables individuals to be free from data restrictions imposed by traditional social platforms, enabling free encrypted transmission and sharing of files.
