This feature is powered by Mask Network’s partner file storage protocols such as IPFS, Arweave and Meson Network.It supports files in PDF, DOC, JPG, PNG, MP3, MP4. and other formats. At present, the maximum file upload size is 10 MB. <0/><1/>You can store files in multiple decentralized networks through the Web3 file service function. When uploading files, you can choose to encrypt or decrypt them. According to the selected upload encrypted method, you can obtain two file links with encryption and non encryption. Users of Mask Network can share files to social platforms through this link. By using encrypted files, you can ensure the security of your files and prevent privacy leakage. <2/><3/>It should be noted that any user who has the link can download and share the file. With the characteristics of decentralized file storage systems, your uploaded files can never be deleted or tampered. Please upload files containing personal privacy with caution. <4/><5/>The Web3 File Service provided by Mask Network enables individuals to be free from data restrictions imposed by traditional social platforms, enabling free encrypted transmission and sharing of files. At present, the service is provisionally free for all users with Mask Network absorbing all the costs. Mask Network will provide updates on future costs users may have to bear."
