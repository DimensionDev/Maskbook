# Blockchain Integration

Mask Network assumes many capabilities that a blockchain should have. For example, a blockchain uses an "address" to locate a crypto-identity, a wallet keeps the crypto stuff safe from risk, and a "block" contains many transactions that push the system to the next state.

The fundamental of blockchain is neutral. We could leverage it to do anything. However, a few years ago, people found financial usage from it and heavily developed it. As a result, almost all blockchains support "tokens" natively to proof of ownership.
