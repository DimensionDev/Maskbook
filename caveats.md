# Caveats for developers

Hi, Welcome to the Mask Network. Here is some note for developing Mask Network.

## Git conventions

`master` branch is our developing branch, `released` branch points to the latest version. [Git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) is recommended but not enforced.

Please use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) when committing.

## Developing

### Load extension into Chrome

- Open `chrome://extensions`
- Enable developer mode
- Click "**Load unpacked version**"
- Select
  - `dist` folder (in **development mode**)
  - `build` folder (after a **production mode** build).

### Load extension into Firefox

- Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
- Click "**Load Temporary Add-on**"
- Select any file in the `dist` folder

## Hot Module Reload

You can use an environment variable `NO_HMR` to close HMR totally.

If you found HMR doesn't work, please open <https://localhost:8080> and ignore the HTTPs certificate error.

## Caveats for Library

- `lodash`, List of unavailable functions.
   1. `_.chain`
   2. `_.template`
