-   Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) since 1.4.0
-   Crypto: We're using [Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC) of the [SECP256-k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) parameters for [secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffieâ€“Hellman) and [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) for encryption
-   Data transfer between users: We're using [gun.js](https://gun.eco)

#### Install dependencies

-   `yarn install`

#### Build and developing

-   `yarn watch` runs a watching mode. Output files in `./dist/`. Load it as unpacked Chrome or Firefox extension
-   `yarn build` build a production version. Output files in `./build/`
-   `yarn test` to run test (we didn't have one yet)
-   `yarn start` to start StoryBook. Used for UI only developing.

#### Non-famous libraries we are using

-   `@holoflows/kit` - A toolkit for extension developing
-   `anchrome` - Use it to detect links in the text
-   `construct-style-sheets-polyfill` - A polyfill for a web api
-   `elliptic` - A crypto library, we use it to encrypt and decrypt
-   `gun` - A decentralized graph databasem we use it to sync user's shared crypto key
-   `pvtsutils` and `tiny-secp256k1` - A crypto library, we use it to zip and unzip SECP256k1 keys but not using it to encrypt/decrypt
-   `serialijse` - A serialization / deserialization library
-   `webcrypto-liner` - A wrapper library, it wrap `elliptic` into WebCrypto API
